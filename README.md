LC-2K Assembler and Linker Projects
Overview
This repository contains implementations of an assembler and linker for the LC-2K architecture. These projects include:

Assembler: A two-pass assembler that translates LC-2K assembly language into machine code.
Linker: A linker that combines multiple object files produced by the assembler into a single executable file.
